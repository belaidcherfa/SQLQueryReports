# SQL Documentation/ Set-Up
In order to create a real enough scenario of a fact table with dimension tables we need data. In the files within this folder are the DDLs for the tables used as well as the insert into statements to populate said tables. The population of these tables is done through random numbers or strings to query from. The table sizes will vary depending on the numbers inserted/provided.


Queries will be performed on the following tables and schemas outlined below. We will query a star schema with one fact table. Afterwards, we will query a galaxy schema with two fact tables to get a sense of runtimes in different warehouses.

### Star Schema
The tables for the star schema are below
